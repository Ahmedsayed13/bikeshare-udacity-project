This data is shared by bike-share company for udacity 
each citiy has a csv file that has a lot of data about it for the first 6 months in year 2017, i used these data to analyze it and then display usefull insights about this city
when the user open the program he/she has to choose a city from the three cities ( chicago- new york- washington)
then the user is asked if he want to filter the data by month or day or both or no filters, if the user choose month he/she will be asked to chose a month from the first 6
months of the year, and if the user chose  day he/she will be asked to choose a day, and if the user chose both he/she will have to choose a month from the first 6 months 
of the year and a day, then the program will run and a very useful insights about the city will be displayed for the user.

Some useful insights include:
1)The peak hour of using bicycles in a day
2)The month with the most users
3)The types of users that use our bicyclce, how many of them are are subscribers and how many are customers
4)How many males and females that use our bicycles? this could be a very useful information to make our bicycles better suit all of our customers
5)The most frequent starting point. ( this also could a very useful insight for the company to make sure that this starting point has enough number of bycicles)
